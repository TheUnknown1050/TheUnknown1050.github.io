                <p >Out of the media we reviewed, there were many good articles and documentaries for learning about war and 
                    peace or note-taking for a school project.<br>But the one that prominently stood out to us 
                    was <a href="https://goprojectfilms.com/films/welcome-to-canada/"><i>Welcome to Canada</i></a>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <i>Welcome to Canada</i> is a short film that shows how it feels to be a Syrian refugee. 
                    About 4.8 million Syrian refugees currently live in neighboring countries, 
                    and even though they aren’t in danger of the war in Syria, it's still not easy for them 
                    to go and settle in a new country, and many still have some family back in Syria. If you 
                    are learning or researching the topic of war and peace, <i>Welcome to Canada</i> is the best piece 
                    of media to watch as it has very high-quality footage and audio, is a very engaging film that 
                    you can easily pay attention to, the interviewee, Mohammed Alsaleh, is credible, and finally, 
                    the short film illustrates the true situation on the ground in Syria.

                            The short film has stunning visual footage of the highest quality. 
                            By just looking at it, you can tell that lots of effort into the 
                            production of the documentary. An example of this is the introduction of the documentary. 
                            It’s a scene of Mohammed Alsaleh riding his bike by the water. The wide-angle shots are perfect, 
                            showing everything in the beautiful scenery of Canada. The music and the narration are peaceful 
                            and calm and fit the mood of the visuals. However, It’s not just the video that is very well done, 
                            the audio is too. The music and sound effects are placed to set the mood of the documentary, precisely making 
                            the audience feel the atmosphere of the situation. The cinematic visuals combined with the immersive audio 
                            provide the perfect experience for anyone who watches.

                        <p>Because of the brilliant video and audio, Welcome 
                            to Canada is also a very engaging documentary. Taking

                            bored while watching as it has interesting content throughout the whole At one point, 
                            Mohammed Alsaleh talks about how he and others were tortured in Syria. The camera focuses on him looking at 
                            the vibrant city. As he lights a cigarette, the music becomes sadder and he talks about what the torture felt 
                            like. Scenes like these immerse you in the Syrian people's stories and make you understand what life really is

                        <p>Leaving aside the visuals for a moment, nobody can deny that what's said in the documentary is very credible. 
                            The interviewee is Mohammed Alsaleh, a Syrian refugee who was granted asylum in Canada. Now he works as a 
                            client, helping new Syrian refugees who come to Canada get settled. Mohammed Alsaleh is credible because he 
                            has lived through the experiences that every Syrian refugee has lived through. He knows how it feels for all 
                            the Syrian refugees. Many people, including Alsaleh, couldn’t bring their families to Canada and are still 
                            trying to. Alsaleh also explains at one point how it feels to see social media updates about the war in Syria. 
                            He says, “For Syrians, it is so normal to open your Facebook and see the death of your friend.” He explains 
                            how hard and difficult it is for them when seeing things like this. Things like this show how the documentary 
                            is credible and has true experiences.

                            Finally, <i>Welcome to Canada</i> really reveals the true situation in Syria. While one might say that they know about 
                            the war in Syria, do they truly know about how the war affected people's lives, how the war destroyed the country 
                            and more? Many people don’t know how much of an impact the Syrian crisis had on its people. According to the 
                            Relief web, provided by OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), 75% of the 
                            refugees from Syria have PTSD, which stands for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It also states that over 50,000 
                            innocent children have been killed. The short film <i>Welcome to Canada</i> really shows what's happening through the 
                            perspective of Alsaleh. In the video, he explains the terrible ways he and many other Syrians were tortured. 
                            It’s depressing that so many people's lives, including children, are ruined because of the crisis. I think this 
                            documentary really brings to the surface what’s happening in Syria, and it illustrates the true situation
                            on the ground.

                        If you are trying to learn about war and peace, or maybe even trying to spread awareness about what’s 
                        going on in the world, <i>Welcome to Canada</i> is certainly the best media to watch. You can easily pay attention 
                        to it because of the high-quality video and audio, and it’s very easy to understand what the narration is 
                        talking about. It’s a very reliable and credible source as the interviewee Mohammed Alsaleh has lived through 
                        the situations the Syrian refugees have and can speak about them. Finally, the documentary spreads awareness 
                        of the Syrian refugee crisis, an awareness that many people don't have, unfortunately. It perfectly shows how 
                        life is in Syria and made me, and likely many others, understand better.
